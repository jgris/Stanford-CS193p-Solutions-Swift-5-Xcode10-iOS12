# Assignment III: Graphical Set, With Extra
## Game mode: User vs User

1. Set Game is a two-player game now.
2. UI updated so both users have their own SET button to claim they see a Set on the game field.
3. The game field is blocked for interaction until one of the users taps the SET button. 
4. After that, the user has some time to select cards. If the set does not match, the move is transferred to another user who also receives a bonus in the form of doubled time to choose a set.
5. If the set matches, the move does not transfer to another user and both users can click on their SET buttons to claim a SET.

Made some changes and improvements in the model API.
